# Data API User Guide

The data API allows you to directly access North Data's company database in JSON or XML format. 

This user guide complements the **reference guide** available here:

https://www.northdata.de/doc/api/index.html

There is also a Swagger / OpenAPI 2.0 specification, available in our Github Repo at:

https://github.com/northdata/api/blob/master/swagger.yaml

## Quick start

An API key is required for using the Data API. To obtain an API key, please contact support@northdata.de.

### Example

The request:

https://www.northdata.de/_api/company/v1/company?address=Hamburg&name=1000MIKES%20AG&api_key=XXXX_XXXX

will result in:

```json
{
  id: "57514825",
  name: {
    name: "1000mikes AG",
    legalForm: "AG"
  },
  address: {
    street: "Hansaplatz 4",
    postalCode: "20099",
    city: "Hamburg",
    country: "DE",
    lat: 53.5541139,
    lng: 10.0116615
  },
  register: {
    city: "Hamburg",
    id: "HRB 103038",
    uniqueKey: "12203550103038"
  },
  status: "liquidation"
}
```
If you use *get* requests, please ***make sure to properly encode parameters***. 

## Authentification

The API is accessed via secure **https** *get* or *post* requests. An API key of the form *XXXX-XXXX* is required.
There are two methods to pass the API key. For production purposes, method 1 with *post* requests is recommended.  

### Method 1: https header

Add the API key as an http header:

```
X-Api-Key: XXXX-XXXX
```

### Method 2: request parameter

Add the API key as a *post* or URL parameter `api_key` such as in:

https://www.northdata.de/_api/company/v1/company?address=Hamburg&name=1000MIKES%20AG&api_key=XXXX_XXXX

## Retrieving single companies

The following requests are available to query a single company:

Request | URL
------- | ---------
retrieve company | https://www.northdata.de/_api/company/v1/company
retrieve publications of a company  | https://www.northdata.de/_api/company/v1/publications

The company is referenced using one or more of the following parameters (which combinations to use depends on your use case and will be explained below).

Parameter name | Type | Explanation
---------------|------|------------
`name` | string | full company name (including legal form)
`address` | string | company address (you only need to specify the city)
`registerId` | string | the ID of under which the company is registered, for example HRB 12345
`registerCity` | string | the city of the court where the company is registered, for example Hamburg
`registerKey` | string | key that has been provided via the *register.uniqueKey* field 
`companyId` | string | internal company id (do not store this id in an external database, it may change over time)
`fuzzyMatch` | boolean | true to find best match (similar name and nearby address) 

These parameters may be used in the following combinations (Germany only).

### Identifying a company by name and city

A company may be identified using the combination of name and city:

```
name=1000MIKES AG
address=Hamburg
```

If you use these parameters in a URL request make sure to encode the parameters properly, e.g:

```
name=1000MIKES%20AG&address=Hamburg
```

Street name and zip code are not required. In Germany, company name and city uniquely identify a company (at a given point of time, which is the time of the request). 

Common differences in writing such as uppercase/lowercase, German umlauts and abbrevations will be handled properly. All of the following are equivalent:

```
name=1000MIKES AG
name=1000mikes AG
name=1000mikes Aktiengesellschaft
```

Also different spellings of the city name will be handled properly, and the following are equivalent:

```
address=Frankfurt
address=Frankfurt am Main
address=Frankfurt a. Main
```

Still, different spellings may cause headaches. If you're not sure whether your name and address data is correct, there is another parameter that may help you:

```
fuzzyMatch=true
```

If this parameter is set, the best matching company is chosen using reasonable probability tresholds. 

### Identifying a company by register ID and court city

German companies that are registered with the German Handelsregister may be identified with their Handelsregister ID and the court city (where the register is located). The combination uniquely identifies a company:

```
registerId=HRB 103038
registerCity=Hamburg
```

Different spellings will be handled propertly, e.g.,

```
registerCity=Ludwigshafen
registerCity=Ludwigshafen a. Rh. 
```

are equivalent. Also, changes caused by the fusion of courts are handled properly. For example, the entry:

```
registerId=HRB 111
registerCity=Husum
```

is equivalent this one (after the *Husum* register was taken over by *Flensburg*)

```
registerId=HRB 111 HU
registerCity=Flensburg
```

To make it easier for you to reference a company, we encode the register identifier into a  unique key so that you don't have to keep track of ID and city. So instead of using `registerId` and `registerCity`, a single parameter may be used:

```
registerKey=12203550103038
```

The unique key can be found in the `register.uniqueKey` field of the company data structure. If you plan to store company data in your database and you want to refer to the North Data database, you would store this unique key (instead of the internal North Data company ID, because the internal company ID might change over time).

### Identifying a company by internal company ID

Companies might also be identified using a `companyId`. This is strongly discouraged, because there are various scenarios where this ID may change overtime (which sounds strange, but there are reasons, as explained in the Appendix, TBD). Please use the unique register key instead (see previous section).

## Accessing company detail information

All of the requests that return information for one or multiple companies:

Request | URL
------- | ---------
retrieve company | https://www.northdata.de/_api/company/v1/company
power search | https://www.northdata.de/_api/search/v1/power
universal search | https://www.northdata.de/_api/search/v1/universal
suggest / auto complete | https://www.northdata.de/_api/search/v1/suggest

will return only base data by default. 

If you want more detail, you may add one or more of the following parameters.

Parameter name | Type | Explanation
---------------|------|------------
history | boolean | true to include historical data
financials | boolean | true to include financial data 
events | boolean | true to include event data 
eventTypes | boolean | restrict which event types wille be returned if events equals true 
maxEvents | boolean | maximum number of events to return 
relations | boolean | true to include related company and person data

If `history` is set to true, the `name`, `address` and `register` history is added to the API response. If `history` is set to true in combination with `financials`, then the known financial history is added to the response.  If `history` is set to true in combination with `relations`, then also formerly related companies and persons are included.

TBD: event types

## Retrieving persons

The following request is available to query a single person:

Request | URL
------- | ---------
retrieve person | https://www.northdata.de/_api/person/v1/person
retrieve publications associated with a person | https://www.northdata.de/_api/person/v1/publications

The person is referenced using one or more of the following parameters (which combinations to use depends on your use case and will be explained below).

Parameter name | Type | Explanation
---------------|------|------------
`firstName` | string | first name
`lastName` | string | last name
`address` | string | person address (you only need to specify the city)
`birthDate` | date | birth date
`personId` | string | internal company id (do not store this id in an external database, it may change over time)

These parameters may be used in the following combinations (Germany only).

### Identifying a person by name, city and birth date

The following combination might be used:
```
firstName=Alfons
lastName=Schuhbeck
address=MÃ¼nchen
birthDate=1949-05-02
```

A properly encoded *get* request might look like:

https://www.northdata.de/_api/person/v1/person?firstName=Alfons&lastName=Schuhbeck&address=M%C3%BCnchen&birthDate=1949-05-02

### Identifying a person by internal person ID

Persons might also be identified using a `personId`. This is strongly discouraged, because there are various scenarios where this ID may change overtime. Please contact us for discussion if you need more detail on this.

## Selecting publications

The followinging request are available to retrieve publications:

Request | URL
------- | ---------
query publications | https://www.northdata.de/_api/pub/v1/publications
retrieve publications associated with a company | https://www.northdata.de/_api/company/v1/publications
retrieve publications associated with a person | https://www.northdata.de/_api/person/v1/publications

These requests share several parameters:

Parameter name | Type | Explanation
---------------|------|------------
sources | string array | restrict which sources are allowed for the returned publications 
content | boolean | whether to include publication text / html 

The default for the `sources` parameter is `sources=Hrb|Eb|Ins` (possible values and their definitions can be found in the reference guide).

## Searching 

TBD.

## Appendix A: Database synchronization

This appendix describes how external databases may be kept in sync using regular updates after an export. 

Please use the publications method of the Data API (link to the reference guide)
https://www.northdata.de/doc/api/index.html#pubV1PublicationsGet

Example (please use your API key and adjust the dates):

https://www.northdata.de/_api/pub/v1/publications?minTimestamp=2017-03-14&maxTimestamp=2017-03-15&sources=Hrb|Eb|Ins|Nd&apiKey=XXXX-XXXX

This method provides all publications of a particular day. We recommend to run a job every day in the early morning to fetch the publications of the previous day. Each publication represents one or multiple events that may result in changes of company data. The response of the API request provides an array of publications. For each publication there is a field publisher, which contains the updated company data. 

In addition, you may want to set the parameters `publisherFinancials`, `publisherRelations`, `publisherHistory`, and/or `publisherEvents` to true in order to retrieve company detail information. 

Please note that the daily number of publications is too high to fit in a single HTTPS call. (Expect 2.000 HR publications, 2.000 Bundesanzeiger publications, 5.000 insolvency publications a day.) Therefore, you should use a loop to fetch all the publications:

1. Set the parameters `minTimestamp` and `maxTimestamp` for the requested time period (recommendation: `minTimestamp` to the previous day and `maxTimestamp` current day. If you omit the time, 0:00 is assumed)
1. Invoke HTTPS API method
1. In case of an HTTP 503 status (service unavailable) retry the call up to two or three times
For all publications the JSON response has a field publisher with the updated company data  -> write this back, but see also below
1. Read the `newPos` field:
   *  not empty -> append as parameter `pos` to the request, continue with step 2
   *  empty -> complete!
1. Looking up company data in your database

It is important **not** to rely on the internal IDs that we provide via the API and the export. The IDs are only valid temporarily and may change over time. There are various real world cases that require us to merge or split company records resulting in changes of the ID. 

Instead, we provide a field `uniqueKey` in `company.registe`r which may serve to safely identify a company. Every company has a current register and a list of historical registers. The best method to retrieve companies is to keep a table that maps registers to companies.

HR_UNIQUE_KEY | YOUR_INTERNAL_COMPANY_ID
--------------|----------------------
21478278742 | company1
89849894894 | company2
38738738733 | company2
 
Please note that you will infrequently encounter company data that has no register or unique key at all. This happens, and unfortunately there is no way to uniquely identify these companies. For example, there may be âRestaurant Shanghai, Berlinâ filing insolvency. There is no way to safely match it. it In this case, you may either (1) drop the update, (2) just append it to your database, (3) solve the case manually.  

## Appendix B: Company entry merger scenarios

Sometimes, North Data needs to merge company entries. The consequence is that internal company IDs may change over time. ***You do not need to know or worry about why this is the case.*** But, we are frequently are asked for the reasons, so here they are.

The reasons are not technical, instead they are related to the federal structure of the German Handelsregister system, and to the history of the publication of mandatory company filings in Germany.

Here are some of the *background* problems of this system:

* every local Handelsregister (HR) has its own numbering scheme (with the exception of Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, where it is state-wide)
* if a company moves from one HR jurisdiction to another, it will be assigned a new HR number
there are other circumstances where a company may be assigned a new HR number (e.g., change of legal form) 
* local Handelsregister courts have been merged in the past (and will probably be merged in the future). Some of these merges haven't been handled well, and resulted in inconsistent numbering (which is history, but, as a bad consequence of this, there is no definitive list of HR number - company available)
* some companies (very few) are registered with more than one Handelsregister at the same time, thus, carrying two HR numbers at the same time. 
* the Bundesanzeiger, which also publishes company information (e.g., yearly reports) does not reference HR IDs 
* the combination of "company name + city" is (by law) unique for a point of time, but (for example) the Vodafone GmbH DÃ¼sseldorf in 2018 may be a different company from the Vodafone GmbH DÃ¼sseldorf in 2015. 
* some companies are not registered with the HR (you are only required to do for particular legal forms, e.g. GmbH, but not GbR). The result is a complete mess, especially if a company changes its legal form from a HR-mandatory one to a non-mandatory one or vice versa.

We do our best to take care of handling these cases. Unfortunately, the handling results in edge cases where we need to merge company entries, resulting in ID changes. Some of these cases are:

* Company moves into the area of different Handelsregister court. The new HR is quick in announcing the new entry, and does not point out that this was a move from another HR (some do, but some do not). Thus, we allocate a new company entry. Later, the old HR closes the old entry, and indicates that the company moved to the new HR. Thus, we have to merge the two company entries, and the newer ID will be deleted. 
* We detect that the same company is registered with two HRs. Then probably we have two entries, and they will need to be merged.
* We found a company in the Bundesanzeiger, and couldn't find the company in the HR (e.g., because of inconsistent naming, say "A. Meier GmbH" in the Bundesanzeiger and "Anton Meier GmbH" in the HR. Later we figure out that they are the same company, and they will need to be merged.
